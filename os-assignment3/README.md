## Question 2

To improve modularity, we've written two seperate applications: a server application (EchoServer.java), and a client applcation (EchoClient.java). The Server must be run first, and then the client application. The server should only be running as a single instance, but the client application can handle multiple instances. No adittional arguments need be passed at run time, except for conventional terminal usage (java EchoServer, java EchoClient). The client application can be exited by typing 'exit', while the server application can be exited by entering cmd+c.

## Deliverables

The programs should be commented where necessary.

Submit only source code and other necessary documentation.

Please name your files appropriately to make it clear which question you are answering.

Include the names of your group in a comment at the top of each program file.

Your submission should be in a single zip file in the following format, where lastname1 is the lastname of student1 and lastname2 is the lastname of student2: lastname1-lastname2-a2.zip 6.Upload your zip file to the SLATE dropbox.
